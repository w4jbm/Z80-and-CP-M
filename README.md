# Z80-and-CP-M
Various small Z80 and CP/M related projects. Many of these assemble under the Z80ASM assembler from SLR.

## CPUTYPE.Z80
This program assembles and runs under CP/M and will tell you the type of processor (8080, Z80, or Z180) you are running. This was originally in a batch of CP/M examples with very little explaination of the logic. I created most of the detailed commentary (130 lines vs 55 lines) for my own edification.
